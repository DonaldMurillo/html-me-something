                            Although the story doesn't begin here, we arrived at Oslo International Airport after a after a 9 hour flight and 15 hour. To our surprise everyone and everything in the airport including the signs were in English. We had never been to Europe before, therefore the only thing greater than our excitement was our fatigue. We took the train from the airport to the inside of the city, a very pleasant and quiet ride.

                            After we arrived at the station, we decided to take our luggage to our hotel. Interestingly enough, the inner streets of Oslo were designed for pedestrian use only. Packed people, the streets were full of life. Once at our hotel, Best Western Karl Johan Hotell on Karl Johan street, we decided to take a nap before we explored the city.

                            After our well deserved nap, we were finally ready to explore the magical country we had been dreaming of visiting. Since it was September, the sun was warm and the breeze was chilly. It was a perfect break from our long, hot and humid summers in Florida. In our list of things to do was:
                            <ul>
                                <li>visit the palace at the end of Karl Johan Street. </li>
                                <li>Find bottle water to drink</li>
                                <li>Go to the national gallery of art to see Munch's The Scream</li>
                                <li>Find dinner</li>

                            </ul>
                    </p>
